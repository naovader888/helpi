Helpi users pay fees in $CELO tokens, and a percentage of it is used to buy back the $HELPI tokens to add liquidity to the protocol. The smart contracts periodically invest user savings (deposits) on real Startups led by migrants in Latin America. The Annual Percentage Return (APR) generated from these DeFi farming protocols are paid to the users of Helpi as interest. The Helpi protocol aggregates the farm’s protocols to get the best APY at all times to ensure users get the best earnings.
